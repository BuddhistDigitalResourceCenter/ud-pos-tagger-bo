# MMPOSTagger

A basic POS Tagger for Tibetan.

It currently only uses Monlam Dictionary's POS Tags converted into UD Tags (a repo about this coming soon!)

Todo: 
 - add the Monlam features in the structure (tags in the dictionary that are not POS)
 - use monlam_verbs.json for the verbs
 - implement the SOAS POS Tags and use them as a first choice (falling back on Monlam where there is no POS)
